# paradoxtest

This uses STL to make things easier, though would probably not be the right way to do it in production
Test method is included for some basic verification. Exact nodes are not verified in cases where there are multiple correct answers, though the solution was verified by hand to be correct.
The algorithm used is A* which can garuntee an optimal path in less computational time than something like Dijkstra's would.
The algorithm could be adapted for various costs of movements fairly easily, which seems like the natural progression for this problem.
